Sometimes I just go to the park to think about things. I actually don't. I'm just typing up some random crap so I can test my edit distance implementation by later changing some of the text in this medium-sized text document. Woah! When the hell did this random sentence get here?!? I'll list a few things I like now. I like penguins because they are cute and chubby. I like Google because I think the goal of organizing information is an awesome one (I like to play with information). I like laptops with long battery life that are 13.3 inches and durable. I like computers with a lot of RAM, so I can run crazy DP solutions to problems, and run many VMs at once. SSDs are also basically a requirement for me on any computer now.
